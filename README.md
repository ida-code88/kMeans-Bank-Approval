This project aims to reveal for some given criterias, are they sufficient enough to decide whether an application for credit card is approved or not? K-Means algorithm is used to cluster all the applicants into two categories: accepted or denied. This algoritm can be used to predict the fate of the next candidates based on their information.

## Outline of this machine learning (clustering) project:
1. Loading and preparing the data:
    * Replacing special characters with string or number
    * converting data type of some columns
    * handling missing values
2. Understanding the distribution of numerical values
3. Performing normalization to dataset:
    * Performing label encoding
    * mormalization of dataset
4. Performing clustering method (KMeans)
5. Evaluating the result of the clustering algorithm
